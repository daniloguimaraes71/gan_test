# gan_test
Test with generative adversarial networks GAN.

## Summary
We reproduce the gan code found in
https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-a-cifar-10-small-object-photographs-from-scratch/ 

We applied the architecture to the simpsons face dataset form 
https://www.kaggle.com/kostastokis/simpsons-faces

Our future goal is to improve on the model and get better results for the reconstruction of the simpsons faces.
